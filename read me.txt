This repository contains *machine learning (ML) models* developed for predicting the corrosion properties of Multi-Principal Element Alloys (MPEAs). The models are trained on a dataset published on Mendeley and are saved here for retrieval and use in corrosion property predictions.

*Getting Started*

The ML models can be accessed and used via a Google Colab notebook, which provides an interactive environment to load models, prepare data, and make predictions.

*Using Google Colab*

Open the Colab notebook: MPEA Corrosion Prediction.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the models and input your data.
Run the cells to generate predictions.
The Colab notebook includes all necessary dependencies and instructions for preparing input data in the correct format.
